cross join:-
Cross joins can lead to a large result set, especially when the participating tables have many
rows.
Syntax:
SELECT columns
FROM table1
CROSS JOIN table2;
In this syntax:
● columns refers to the specific columns you want to retrieve from the cross-joined
tables.
● table1 and table2 are the names of the tables you want to combine using a cross
join.
Example: Consider two tables: Students and Courses.
Students Table:
StudentID StudentName
1 Alice

2 Bob

Courses Table:
CourseID CourseName
101 Maths
102 Science

Cross Join Query:
SELECT Students.StudentName, Courses.CourseName
FROM Students
CROSS JOIN Courses;
Result:

StudentName CourseName
Alice Maths
Alice Science
Bob Maths
Bob Science
